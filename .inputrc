# --- General Behavior ---

# Why: Immediately show all possibilities if there's more than one match.
set show-all-if-ambiguous on

# Why: Improve scannability of completions via colors and prefix highlighting.
set colored-stats on
set colored-completion-prefix on

# Why: Prevents double-completion bugs (e.g., "cd ~/src/mozillail") by ignoring 
# text already present after the cursor.
set skip-completed-text on


# --- Search & Navigation ---

# Why: Support both ANSI (\e[) and Application (\eO) sequences. 
# Some programs leave the terminal in Application mode, which breaks standard bindings.
"\e[A": history-search-backward
"\eOA": history-search-backward
"\e[B": history-search-forward
"\eOB": history-search-forward

# Why: Specific binding for filename-only completion via Option+Tab.
M-TAB: complete-filename
